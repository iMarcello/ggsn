\title{North symbol 2}
\usage{
north2(ggp, x = 0.65, y = 0.9, scale = 0.1, symbol = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ggp}{ggplot2 object.}

\item{x}{number between 0 and 1 to indicate the x axis position of the symbol's bottom left corner. 0 is the left side and 1 the right side.}

\item{y}{number between 0 and 1 to indicate the y axis position of the symbol's bottom left corner. 0 is the bottom and 1 the top.}

\item{scale}{number between 0 and 1 to indicate the symbol size as a proportion of the plot area (not the map size).}

\item{symbol}{number between 1 and 18 to choose a symbol (see \code{\link{northSymbols}}).}
}
\description{
Alternative implementation to add a north symbol to maps created with ggplot or map.
}
\details{
North symbols are included in the plot with the \code{\link{annotation_custom}} function, which do not works when used together with an empty call to ggplot (see last example). When it is convenient to use an empty call to ggplot, use \code{\link{north2}} instead.

\examples{
library(sf)
dsn <- system.file('extdata', package = 'ggsn')
map <- st_read(dsn, 'sp')

# If "map" is a "sp" object, convert it to "sf" with map <- st_as_sf(map).

map2 <- ggplot(map, aes(fill = nots)) +
    geom_sf() +
    scale_fill_brewer(name = 'Animal abuse\\nnotifications', palette = 8)
north2(map2, .5, .5)
